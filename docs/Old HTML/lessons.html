      <h2 align="left">Our Focus</h2>
      <p align="left" class="thrColElsHdr">Our primary focus is to develop the sensitive, compassionate partnering of horse and rider. The harmonious communication can be seen in those who have elevated horsemanship to &quot;living art,&quot; to quote Charles de Kunffy. Our desire is to kindle a passion for the art of traditional horsemanship -- to ride from a place of integrity, heart, soul, and center. We are committed to the pursuit of excellence and the evolution of horse and rider.</p>
      <p align="left" class="thrColElsHdr"><em>&quot;The ancient Greeks believed the body, mind, and soul to be the three components of a person. These three facets of a rider must always be in perfect balance. The cultivation of one at the expense of the other two components will result in disharmony and discord. However, when equally cultivated and attended to, they will produce a harmonious partnership, which espresses itself in beauty.&quot;</em></p>
      <p align="right" class="thrColElsHdr">- Charles de Kunffy</p>

      <p align="left">ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS!!! (Ages 8 – 15) Our Saturday Program is conducted from 9 – 4 throughout the year. It is replaced by our Summer Program from June – August. Just like our Summer Program, kids get a mounted group lesson and participate in all aspects of stable management and equine care. There is also classroom instruction which is based on the US Pony Club manual. </p>
      <h3>Lessons</h3>
      <p>Cost $35.00 per 1/2 hour | $60.00 per hour</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>“Intensives”</h3>
      <p>We offer seven days six nights intensive training programs on our horses. During the term, students receive two lessons per day. The needs of the student dictate the type of lesson which is given. Usually we try to incorporate longeing, gymnastic jumping, and dressage.</p>

Most hotels are within 30 minutes of our facility and rates are between $75.00 and $200.00 per night. We also offer the rental of our guest room and bath at the rate of $60.00 per night. There is a refrigerator and you may use our kitchen, washer/dryer, Jacuzzi, and exercise equipment.</p>
